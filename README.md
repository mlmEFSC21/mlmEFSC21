- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthew
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development, mobile development, automation, AI & machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development as a discipline. This GitHub account was created as part of a school project and I have continued to use it for other classes. I am most interested in gaining a deeper understanding and mastery over web development as I believe it is the easiest and best way to serve the most people.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything if you're willing to be patient. I have never participated in a collaborative project before.
- 📫 How to reach me mattsoftwaredev89@gmail.com. Please no spamerino.
